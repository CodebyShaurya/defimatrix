# Copy this file to .env.local and (optionally) update values.
# In Next.js, variables prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_ are exposed to the browser.



# Notes:
# - Do NOT commit your real .env.local to source control. This example file is safe to commit.
# - If you need server-only secrets, do NOT prefix them with NEXT_PUBLIC_ and keep them in .env.local.
