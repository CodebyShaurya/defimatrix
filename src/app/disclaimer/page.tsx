          DeFiMatrix maintains this site and you agree that these terms of use and any legal action or proceeding
          relating to this site shall be governed by the laws of the State of Illinois without reference to its choice
          of law rules. If you attempt to bring any legal proceedings against DeFiMatrix you specifically acknowledge
          that DeFiMatrix is free to choose the jurisdiction of our preference as to where such action against us may be
          held. We will probably choose to defend any such action in Illinois and we can make this decision entirely as
          it suits us, without regard to where in the world you are located, or from where in the world you visited this
          site.
        </p>

        <p>
          You are responsible for complying with the laws of the jurisdiction from which you are accessing this site and
          you agree that you will not access or use the information on this site in violation of such laws. Unless
          expressly stated otherwise herein, any information submitted by you through this site shall be deemed
          non-confidential and non-proprietary. You represent that you have the lawful right to submit such information
          and agree that you will not submit any information unless you are legally entitled to do so. Because of the
          open nature of the Internet, we recommend that you not submit information you consider confidential.

        <p>
          DeFiMatrix does not accept unauthorized idea submissions outside of established business relationships. To
          protect the interests of our current clients and ourselves, we must treat the issue of such submissions with
          great care. Importantly, without a clear business relationship, DeFiMatrix cannot and does not treat any such
          submissions in confidence. Accordingly, please do not communicate unauthorized idea submissions to DeFiMatrix
          through this website. Any ideas disclosed to DeFiMatrix outside a pre-existing and documented confidential
          business relationship are not confidential and DeFiMatrix may therefore develop, use and freely disclose or
          publish similar ideas without compensating you or accounting to you. DeFiMatrix will make every reasonable
          effort to return or destroy any unauthorized idea submissions without detailed review of them. However, if a
          review is necessary in DeFiMatrix&apos;s sole discretion, it will be with the understanding that DeFiMatrix
          assumes no obligation to protect the confidentiality of your idea or compensate you for its disclosure or use.
          By submitting an idea or other detailed submission to DeFiMatrix through this website, you agree to be bound
          by the terms of this stated policy.
