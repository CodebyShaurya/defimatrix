# About DeFiMatrix

DeFiMatrix is the world's first intent-driven, AI-powered DeFi platform, enabling users to express financial goals in natural language and have them autonomously executed across protocols and chains via intelligent agents and solver networks.

To maintain our edge in composability, liquidity optimization, and intent fulfillment, we're hiring a forward-thinking Protocol Research Analyst to evaluate emerging DeFi infrastructure and strategically guide integrations that expand our capabilities.

## Role Overview

As a Protocol Research Analyst, you'll serve as the intelligence layer behind DeFiMatrix's integration roadmap. You'll continuously monitor, evaluate, and recommend DeFi protocol partnerships and integrations that enhance our platform's functionality, liquidity access, and competitive advantage.

This role is ideal for someone deeply embedded in the DeFi ecosystem—who thrives on exploring new protocols, uncovering value-aligned primitives, and shaping platform decisions through data, research, and analysis.

## Key Responsibilities

- Research and evaluate emerging DeFi protocols across verticals such as AMMs, lending/borrowing, liquid staking, yield aggregators, derivatives, bridges, and stablecoins
- Recommend strategic integrations based on liquidity depth, user alignment, composability, and on-chain activity
- Track the evolution of multi-chain DeFi ecosystems (Ethereum, L2s, Cosmos, Solana, etc.) and their core infrastructure components
- Analyze protocol mechanics, including incentives, security, governance, oracle dependencies, and capital efficiency
- Collaborate with product, engineering, and growth teams to prioritize protocol integration pipelines
- Produce research memos, dashboards, and protocol briefs to support strategic decisions and public communications
- Build and maintain a living repository of protocol data, categorizing integrations by TVL, risk, reputation, network compatibility, and technical requirements
- Stay active in forums, DAO governance channels, Twitter/X, and Discords to track protocol updates and community signals
- Contribute to integration scoping, partnership conversations, and GTM strategies

## Requirements

### Must-Have

- 2–4 years of experience in crypto research, investment analysis, or DeFi product strategy
- Deep understanding of DeFi primitives and how protocols interoperate within a composable ecosystem
- Strong analytical skills with experience evaluating tokenomics, protocol models, and on-chain metrics
- Excellent writing and communication skills—able to distill complex protocols into actionable insights
- Comfort working autonomously and collaborating across product, engineering, and marketing functions

### Nice-to-Have

- Experience contributing to DAOs, governance proposals, or protocol design discussions
- Familiarity with cross-chain architectures, ZK/rollup technologies, and liquidity routing algorithms
- Exposure to AI agent systems, DeFi intents, or solver networks
- Technical background (solidity familiarity, basic smart contract reading) is a plus

## What We Offer

- Competitive salary + token/equity incentives
- Full ownership over protocol intelligence and integration recommendations
- Remote-first culture with async flexibility and global collaboration
- Access to premium analytics platforms, DeFi communities, and protocol insiders
- Conference, research, and education stipends (ETHGlobal, Token2049, DuneCon, etc.)
- A unique opportunity to influence DeFiMatrix's roadmap and composability strategy in a fast-growing sector
